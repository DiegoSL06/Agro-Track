## üöÄ About Us :3
We are a group of students from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey at the Sonora Norte campus in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. We joined this competition because the challenges are not only difficult and rewarding, but also actively seek to achieve positive change in the world and how we interact with it. We joined NASA's cause to improve how we live and what the future holds for us.
